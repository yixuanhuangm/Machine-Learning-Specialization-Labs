# Machine Learning Specialization Labs

This repository contains the lab exercises and project files from the **Machine Learning Specialization** course on Coursera. It includes all the hands-on assignments and coding projects I completed during the course.

## Course Overview

The **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng, covers essential topics in machine learning, including:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Neural networks
- Deep learning techniques
- Reinforcement learning

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual folders for each lab exercise. Each folder contains the relevant Jupyter notebook and any necessary resources for that lab.

## Notes

- Each lab folder may contain additional resources, such as data files, helper scripts, or images used in the analysis.
- The notebook files contain step-by-step explanations of the lab exercises and solutions to the problems presented in the course.

## License
